Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering involves software product design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance.
software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and system that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development programme language
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s.
The advent of structured programming in 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documentating users needs and system requirements.
Design: creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and other interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specification.
Testing: conducting various tests to ensure the software meet quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to user or customer.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, update and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
This is a sequential approach with distinct phases(requirements, design, implementation) flowing downward like a waterfall.
Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focusing on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
Quality Assurance Engineer: ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plan.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environment: software suites that provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code.
Version Control Systems: software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadline, Requirements, Technical debts.
one way to overcome this is to ensure prioritization of tasks, effective communication and agile methodologies.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing: Testing individual components or module of software.
Integration testing:testing interactions between different components or subsystem.
system testing: testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing: testing the software against user to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about your questions or instructions that helps get the best responses from your robot or AI assistant.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
How to cook rice? this is a vague prompt.
Act as a chef, give a step by step comprehensive guide on how to make jollof rice with all the necessary recipes.
